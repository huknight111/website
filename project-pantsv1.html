                <p>The goal was to recreate a pair of pants i own but slightly longer and with a thicker fabric. It was accepted that these were
                    a first try for me and lukas who was working on a pair concurrently, but we wanted to be able to wear them without standing out
                    for the wrong reasons. We traced patterns from existing pants, which was much easier than when I had created a pattern from scratch
                    and not been very happy with the result. Though I traced directly around the pants and didnt include seam allowance and did so as I 
                    cut the fabric instead which I believe led to having too much seam allowance making the pants too baggy, this along with the heavier
                    fabric makes them appear alot more baggy, which is my main qualm with, I think there was alot of variability from my test pair which
                    led to the fit of the final pair being not quite what I expected. The sewing process was sweet and the first time through
                    the zipper sewing process went very well. I used a flat felled seam on the outer leg seams which was quite difficult and led to some
                    slightly sloppy stitches, I think I'll avoid these for thicker fabrics or at the very least be very careful when attempting. I used 
                    double stitched seams (single stitching, pressing open and sewing down the seam allowance on both sides) and this looks quite clean
                    I havent seen any wear from these stitches yet so they seem strong. We watched all the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies and a few 
                    others, it was probably 30 hours where one of us was working the other watching the movie / eating / doing homework, it's always good
                    experience to gain from a long project like this and the results are overall very solid, we are both now working on a second pair 
                    and I feel noticably more confident and can move faster and make better stitches this time around.
